## Project Description
Client is expecting a baby, and unsure what to name the child.  In this project we will sort through raw data 
for baby names and their popularity between the years 2015 and 2016.

##Study design and data processing
We have to data sets (2015 and 2016).  The data each contain variable Name, Gender, and the Total number of children
who received each name in the corresponding year.

###Collection of the raw data
Unknown

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Raw data contains no headers or variable names.  We've assgined Name, Gender, Total, and GTotal respectively during
the data clean up and organization process.

##Creating the tidy datafile
We've assgined Name, Gender, Total, and GTotal respectively during
the data clean up and organization process.

###Guide to create the tidy data file
1) Downloaded/Imported data for 2016
2) Assigned variable names (Name,Gender,Total)
3) Identified and removed duplicate entry (Fionayyy was a duplicate of Fiona)
4) Downloaded/Imported data for 2015
5) Assigned variable names (Name,Gender,Total)
6) Merged 2016 with 2015 based on the Name variable
7) Create new variable which totals the number of instances for each name in both years combined (GTotal)
8) Assess popularity by sorting the names by GTotal.
9) Client having a girl, so apply a filter by gender to return a list of the top 10 girls names for the combined years.
 
###Cleaning of the data
*See Above

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
*Data Frame with 32868 observations and 4 variable
Name - factor    *This variable provides the actual name given to children born in 2015 and 2016 respectively
Gender - factor  *This variable provides the gender of the child
Total - integer  *This variable provides the total number of children assigned to each name 
GTotal - integer *This variable provides a grand total for each name for the combined years
